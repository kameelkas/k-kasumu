          Hey! I&apos;m Kameel, a final year Software & Mechatronics Engineering
          student at the University of Calgary. I previously interned at
          Seequent as a Software Developer Intern, where I primarily worked on
          the UI/UX of a geotechnical analysis software. In my free time, I
          enjoy creating full-stack web applications, and exploring various
          realms of software engineering and development. Outside of software,
          I&apos;m usually watching sports, managing my fantasy teams, or
          playing video games.
