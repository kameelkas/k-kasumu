          Hey! I&apos;m Kameel, a final year Software & Mechatronics Engineering student at the
          University of Calgary. I previously interned at Seequent as a Software
          Developer Intern, where I primarily worked on the UI/UX of a
          geotechnical analysis software. In my free time, I enjoy creating
          full-stack web applications, and exploring various realms of software
          engineering and development. Outside of software, I&apos;m usually
          watching sports, managing my fantasy teams, or playing video games.
